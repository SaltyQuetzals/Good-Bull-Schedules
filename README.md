# Good-Bull-Schedules
Open-source scheduling server for Texas A&amp;M University students, written in Django.

## Contributing
We'd love to have you contribute! We want to encourage all kinds of developers (inexperienced and experienced) to contribute to this project, to make it the best that it can be.

## Goals
- Create an open, no-auth-needed API for students to analyze TAMU course/section data without having to create their own scrapers.
- Create an intuitive, content-based search interface that allows students to search courses based on the content they cover, not just keyword matching.
- Provide a readable, modular, and extensible (in order of priority) backend server for helping students make their schedules.

## Future Goals
- Adding courses to a student's personal calendar.
- Create a system based on schedule clusters to recommend classes to students based on their schedule.
- Implement a comment/rating system for students to provide feedback on courses for further analytics.
